Flask-Login Changelog
===============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Flask-Login release.

Version 0.2.7-dev
-----------

(release date to be announced)

- Session data is now only read when the user is requested. This can be
  beneficial for cookie and caching control when differenting between
  requests that use user information for rendering and ones where all users
  (including anonymous) get the same result (e.g. static pages)
- BREAKING: User *must* always be accessed through the ``current_user``
  local. This breaks any previous direct access to ``_request_ctx.top.user``.
  This is because user is not loaded until current_user is accessed.
- Fixes unnecessary access to the session when the user is anonymous
  and session protection is active.
  see https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/issues/120
- Fixes issue where order dependency of applying the login manager
  before dependent applications was required.
